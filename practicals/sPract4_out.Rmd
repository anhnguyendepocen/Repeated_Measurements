## Practical 4: Mixed Effects Models for Discrete Data
We start by loading the packages we will need for this practical and the data from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/drizopoulos/Repeated_Measurements). This is achieved with the
following commands:
```{r}
# packages
library("lattice")
library("geepack")
library("splines")

# data
con <- url("https://raw.github.com/drizopoulos/Repeated_Measurements/master/Data.RData")
load(con)
close(con)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
options(warn = (-1))
```
